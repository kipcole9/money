### Soft Deprecation

* The option `:fractional_digits` for `Money.from_integer/3` has been deprecated in favour of `:currency_digits` for consistency with `Money.round/2` and functions in [ex_cldr_numbers](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_cldr_numbers). `:fractional_digits` will continue to be supported for an indefinite period.

### Bug Fixes

* Ensure `Money.split/3` always returns a remainder that is greater than or equal to 0. Thanks to @jdewar for the report and @coladarci, @Wigny for their collaboration. Closes #173.

* Allow a [non-breaking-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space) to be part of a number string. Some locales (like `en-ZA`) will format numbers with a nbsp when using standard separators for that locale.

### Enhancements

* Adds support for [ISO 24165 Digital Tokens (crypto currency)](https://www.iso.org/standard/80601.html). Digital Token-based money behaves the same as currency-based money with the following exceptions due to limited data availability:

  * Digital token names are not localized (there is no localised data available in CLDR)
  * Digital token names are not pluralized (also because there is no localised data available)
  * Digital token amounts are never rounded (there is no data available to standardise on rounding rules or the number of fractional digits to round to)

## Money v5.10.0

This is the changelog for Money v5.10.0 released on April 6th, 2022.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Enhancements

* Updates to [ex_cldr version 2.26.0](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_cldr/2.26.0) and [ex_cldr_numbers version 2.25.0](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_cldr_numbers/2.25.0) which use atoms for locale names and rbnf locale names. This is consistent with other elements of `t:Cldr.LanguageTag` where atoms are used when the cardinality of the data is fixed and relatively small and strings where the data is free format.

* Adjusts the output of `Money.inspect/2` to be executable code. Instead of `#Money<:USD, 100>` the output will be `Money.new(:USD, "100")`. This improved developer experience by allowing for copy/paste of `inspect/2` results into `iex`. It is also in line with similar changes being made in `elixir`, `Decimal` and others.

* Add documentation for `:currency_symbol` option for `Money.to_string/2`. Although its an option that is passed through to `Cldr.Number.to_string/3`, its very relevant to `t:Money` formatting.

    that will used if no currency code, symbol or description is
    indentified in the parsed string. The default is `nil`
    which means that the default currency associated with
    the `:locale` option will be used. If `false` then the
    currency assocated with the `:locale` option will not be
    used and an error will be returned if there is no currency
    in the string being parsed.

* Add certificate verification for exchange rate retrieval

## Money v5.0.0

This is the changelog for Money v5.0.0 released on January 21st, 2020.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Breaking changes

* Elixir 1.10 introduces semantic sorting for stucts that depends on the availability of a `compare/2` function that returns `:lt`, `:eq` or `:gt`.  Therefore in this release of `ex_money` the functions `compare/2` and `compare!/2` are swapped with `cmp/2` and `cmp!/2` in order to conform with this expectation. Now `compare/2` will return `:eq`, `:lt` or `:gt`. And `cmp/2` return `-1`, `0` or `1`.

* Deprecate `Money.reduce/1` in favour of `Money.normalize/1` to be consistent with `Decimal` versions `1.9` and later.

It is believed and tested that `Money` version `5.0.0` is compatible with all versions of `Decimal` from `1.6` up to the as-yet-unreleased `2.0`.

### Support of Elixir 1.10 Enum sorting

From Elixir verison `1.10.0`, several functions in the `Enum` module can use the `Money.compare/2` function to simplify sorting. For example:

```
iex> list = [Money.new(:USD, 100), Money.new(:USD, 200)]
[#Money<:USD, 100>, #Money<:USD, 200>]
iex> Enum.sort list, Money
[#Money<:USD, 100>, #Money<:USD, 200>]
iex> Enum.sort list, {:asc, Money}
[#Money<:USD, 100>, #Money<:USD, 200>]
iex> Enum.sort list, {:desc, Money}
[#Money<:USD, 200>, #Money<:USD, 100>]
```
**Note that `Enum.sort/2` will sort money amounts even when the currencies are incompatible. In this case the order of the result is not predictable. It is the developers responsibility to filter the list to compatible currencies prior to sorting. This is a limitation of the `Enum.sort/2` implementation.**

### Notes on Decimal version support

* `ex_money` version `5.0.0` is compatible with `Decimal` versions from `1.6` onwards. In `Decimal` version `2.0` the same changes to `compare/2` and `cmp/2` will occur and in `Decimal` version `1.9`, `Decimal.cmp/2` is deprecated.  `ex_money` version `5.0.0` detects these different versions of `Decimal` and therefore remains compatability with `Decimal` back to version `1.6`.

## Money v4.4.2

This is the changelog for Money v4.4.2 released on January 2nd, 2020.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Remove calls to `Code.ensure_compiled?/1` since it is deprecated in Elixir 1.10. Use instead `Cldr.Config.ensure_compiled?/1` which is added as a private API in `Cldr` version 2.12.0. This version of `Cldr` now becomes the minimum version required.

* Remove spurious entries in `.dialyzer_ignore_warnings` - no entries are required and dialyzer is happy.

## Money v4.4.1

This is the changelog for Money v4.4.1 released on November 10th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes money parsing error. Thanks to @Doerge. Closes #112.

## Money v4.4.0

This is the changelog for Money v4.4.0 released on November 6th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Breaking Change

* `Money.parse/2` until this release supported the `:currency_filter` option. It allowed for currencies to be filtered based upon their attributes (`:all`, `:current`, `:historic`, `:tender`, `:annotated`). When multiple attributes were passed in a list, a currency had to meet all of these attributes. From this release onwards, multiple attributes items are `or`ed, not `and`ed. It is expected this option is used extremely rarely and therefore of limited impact.

### Enhancements

* `Money.parse/2` now includes the option `:default_currency` which allows for parsing a number only (without a currency code) and it will be tagged with the `:default_currency`.
```elixir
  iex> Money.parse("100")
  {:error,
   {Money.Invalid,
    "A currency code, symbol or description must be specified but was not found in \"100\""}}
  iex> Money.parse("100", default_currency: :USD)
  #Money<:USD, 100>
```

* Add `:only` and `:except` options to `Money.parse/2` to specify which currency codes or currency attributes are permitted.  `:only` and `:except` replace the option `:currency_filter` which is now deprecated. If provided, `:currency_filter` is interpreted as `:only`. An example:
```elixir
  iex> Money.parse("100 usd", only: :current, except: :USD)
  {:error,
   {Money.UnknownCurrencyError,
    "The currency \"usd\" is unknown or not supported"}}
```

* `Money.parse/2` now supports negative money amounts.
```elixir
  iex> Money.parse("chf -100")
  #Money<:CHF, -100>

  iex> Money.parse("(chf 100)")
  #Money<:CHF, -100>
```
* The money parser has been rewritten using [nimble_parsec](https://hex,pm.packages/nimble_parsec)

## Money v4.3.0

This is the changelog for Money v4.3.0 released on September 8th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Enhancements

* Adds a `Money` backend in the same spirit as other libraries that leverge [ex_cldr](https://hex,pm/packages/ex_cldr). Thanks to @Lostkobrakai. Closes #108. All of the functions in the `Money` module may also be called on a backend module `<backend>.Money.fun` without having to specify a backend module since this is implicit.

### Bug Fixes

* `Money.new!/3` replaces `Money.new!/2` to accept options. Thanks to @Lostkobrakai. Closes #109.

## Money v4.2.2

This is the changelog for Money v4.2.2 released on September 7th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Use `Keyword.get_lazy` when the default is `Cldr.default_backend/0` to avoid exceptions when no default backend is configured. Thanks to @Lostkobrakai. Closes #108.

## Money v4.2.1

This is the changelog for Money v4.2.1 released on September 2nd, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes parsing of money amount that have a single digit amount. Closes #107.  Thanks to @njwest

## Money v4.2.0

This is the changelog for Money v4.2.0 released on 21 August, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Move the `Money.Migration` module to [ex_money_ecto](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_money_sql) where it belongs

### Enhancements

* `Money.default_backend/0` will now either use the backend configured under the `:default_cldr_backend` key of `ex_money` or `Cldr.default_backend/0`. In either case an exeption will be raised if no default backend is configured.

## Money v4.1.0

This is the changelog for Money v4.1.0 released on July 13th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Enhancements

* Adds `Money.abs/1`. Thanks to @jeremyjh.

* Improve `@doc` consistency using `## Arguments` not `## Options`.

## Money v4.0.0

This is the changelog for Money v4.0.0 released on July 8th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Breaking Changes

* Functions related to the serialization of money types have been extracted to the library [ex_money_sql](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_money_sql).  For applications using the dependency `ex_money` that *do not* require serialization no changes are required.  For applications using serialization, the dependency should be changed to `ex_money_sql` (which in turn depends on `ex_money`).

* Supports Elixir 1.6 and later only

## Money v3.4.4

This is the changelog for Money v3.4.4 released on June 2nd, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Enhancements

* Supports passing an `Cldr.Number.Formation.Options.t` as alternative to a `Keyword.t` for options to `Money.to_string/2`.  Performance is doubled when using pre-validated options which is useful if formatting is being executed in a tight loop.

An example of this usage is:

```elixir
  iex> money = Money.new(:USD, 100)

  # Apply any options required as a keyword list
  # Money will take care of managing the `:currency` option
  iex> options = []

  iex> {:ok, options} = Cldr.Number.Format.Options.validate_options(0, backend, options)
  iex> Money.to_string(money, options)
```

The `0` in `validate_options` is used to determine the sign of the amount because that can influence formatting - for example the accounting format often uses `(1234)` as its format.  If you know your amounts are always positive, just use `0`.

If the use case may have both positive and negative amounts, generate two option sets (one with the positive number and one with the negative).  Then use the appropriate option set.  For example:

```elixir
  iex> money = Money.new(:USD, 1234)

  # Add options as required
  # Money will take care of managing the `:currency` option
  iex> options = []

  iex> {:ok, positive_options} = Cldr.Number.Format.Options.validate_options(0, backend, options)
  iex> {:ok, negative_options} = Cldr.Number.Format.Options.validate_options(-1, backend, options)

  iex> if Money.cmp(money, Money.zero(:USD)) == :gt do
  ...>   Money.to_string(money, positive_options)
  ...> else
  ...>   Money.to_string(money, negative_options)
  ...> end
```

## Money v3.4.3

This is the changelog for Money v3.4.3 released on June 2nd, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Ensure `Money.to_string!/2` properly raises

* Add specs for `Money.to_string/2` and `Money.to_string!/2`

Thanks to @rodrigues for the report and PR.

## Money v3.4.2

This is the changelog for Money v3.4.2 released on April 16th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* `Money.put_fraction/2` now correctly allows setting the fraction to 0.

### Enhancements

* `Money.round/2` allows setting `:currency_digits` to an integer number of digits in addition to the options `:iso`, `:cash` and `:accounting`.  The default remains `:iso`.

* Improves the documentation for `Money.to_string/2`.

This is the changelog for Money v3.3.0 released on February 24th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Enhancements

* Adds `Money.put_fraction/2`. This will set the fractional part of a money to the specified integer amount.  Examples:
```
  iex> Money.put_fraction Money.new(:USD, "2.49"), 99
  #Money<:USD, 2.99>

  iex> Money.put_fraction Money.new(:USD, "2.49"), 999
  {:error,
   {Money.InvalidAmountError, "Rounding up to 999 is invalid for currency :USD"}}
```

### Bug Fixes

* Parsing money strings now uses a more complete set of character definitions for decimal and grouping separators based upon the `characters.json` file of the "en" locale.

## Money v3.2.4

This is the changelog for Money v3.2.4 released on February 13th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Updates to [ex_cldr_currencies version 2.1.2](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_cldr_currencies/2.1.2) which correctly removes duplicate currency strings when the same string referred to different currency codes. See the [changelog](https://github.com/kipcole9/cldr_currencies/blob/v2.1.2/CHANGELOG.md) for further detail.

### Enhancements

* Adds a `:fuzzy` option to `Money.parse/2` that uses `String.jaro_distance/2` to help determine if the provided currency text can be resolved as a currency code.  For example:
```
  iex> Money.parse("100 eurosports", fuzzy: 0.8)
  #Money<:EUR, 100>

  iex> Money.parse("100 eurosports", fuzzy: 0.9)
  {:error,
   {Money.Invalid, "Unable to create money from \\"eurosports\\" and \\"100\\""}}
```

## Money v3.2.3

This is the changelog for Money v3.2.3 released on February 12th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Correctly parse money strings with unicode currency symbols like "€". Closes #95.  Thanks to @crbelaus.

## Money v3.2.2

This is the changelog for Money v3.2.2 released on February 10th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Enhancements

* Improves parsing of money strings. Parsing now uses various strings that [CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org) knows about.  Some examples:

```elixir
 iex> Money.parse "$au 12 346", locale: "fr"
 #Money<:AUD, 12346>
 iex> Money.parse "12 346 dollar australien", locale: "fr"
 #Money<:AUD, 12346>
 iex> Money.parse "A$ 12346", locale: "en"
 #Money<:AUD, 12346>
 iex> Money.parse "australian dollar 12346.45", locale: "en"
 #Money<:AUD, 12346.45>
 iex> Money.parse "AU$ 12346,45", locale: "de"
 #Money<:AUD, 12346.45>

 # Can also return the strings available for a given currency
 # and locale
 iex> Cldr.Currency.strings_for_currency :AUD, "de"
 ["aud", "au$", "australischer dollar", "australische dollar"]

 # Round trip formatting also seems to be ok
 iex> {:ok, string} = Cldr.Number.to_string 1234, Money.Cldr, currency: :AUD
 iex> Money.parse string
 #Money<:AUD, 1234.00>
```
## Money v3.2.1

This is the changelog for Money v3.2.1 released on February 2nd, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Added `Money.Ecto.Composite.Type.cast/1` and `Money.Ecto.Map.Type.cast/1` for a `String.t` parameter. When a `String.t` is provided, `cast/1` will call `Money.parse/2` to create the `Money.t`.

* `Money.new/3` now uses the current locale on the default backend if no locale or backend is specified. This means that `Money.Ecto.Composite.Type.cast/1` and `Money.Ecto.Map.Type.cast/1` will be parsed using the locale that has been set for the current process in the default backend. As a result, a simple `type=text` form field can be used to input a money type (currency code and amount in a single string) that can then be cast to a `Money.t`.

## Money v3.2.0

This is the changelog for Money v3.2.0 released on February 1st, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Correctly generate `migrations_path/1` function based upon whether `Ecto` is configured and which version

### Enhancements

* Adds `Money.parse/2` which will parse a string comprising a currency code and an amount. It will return a `Money.t` or an error.  This function may be helpful in supporting money input in HTML forms.

## Money v3.1.0

This is the changelog for Money v3.1.0 released on December 30th, 2018.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix typo in `exchange_rates_retriever.ex`.  Thanks to @lostkobrakai.  Closes #91.

* Remove obsolete `cldr` compiler

* Changes the `sum` aggregate function for `money_with_currency` to be `STRICT` which means it handles `NULL` columns in the same way as the standard `SUM` function.  Thanks to @lostkobrakai.  Closes #88.

* Fixes documentation link errors

* Fix unhandled terminate typo error in exchange rates server. Thanks to @xavier. Closes #90.

## Money v3.0.0

This is the changelog for Money v3.0.0 released on November 23rd, 2018.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/tags)

The primary purpose of this release is to support ex_cldr version 2.0

### Breaking changes

* `Money.from_tuple/1` has been removed
* Uses [ex_cldr](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_cldr/2.0.0) version 2.  Please see [the changelog](https://github.com/kipcole9/cldr/blob/v2.0.1/CHANGELOG.md#migrating-from-cldr-1x-to-cldr-version-2x) for configuration changes that are required.
* Requires a default_cldr_backend to be configured in `config.exs`.  For example:
```
  config :ex_money,
    ...
    default_cldr_backend: MyApp.Cldr
  end
```
